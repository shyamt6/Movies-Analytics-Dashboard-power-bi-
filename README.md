I am excited to share my recently completed Power BI Project – Movies Analytics Dashboard 🎬📊

This project analyzed a dataset of 1,000+ movies released between 2006 and 2016, covering attributes such as Rank, Title, Genre, Director, Actors, Runtime, Ratings, Votes, Revenue, and Metascore.

🔍 Key Focus Areas:

Movie Overview & Trends: Yearly releases, revenue growth, average ratings, and runtime patterns.

Genre & Rating Analysis: Distribution of movies, average ratings, metascores, and revenue contribution by genre.

Top Performers: Highest revenue-generating movies & directors, and most-voted movies.

Advanced Insights: Correlation of revenue with ratings, votes, runtime, and genre.

🛠 Tools & Techniques:

Data Cleaning & Transformation

Power BI Visuals (Cards, Line/Bar/Column Charts, Treemaps, Scatter Plots, Waterfall & Funnel Charts, Matrix, Boxplots)

DAX Measures for KPIs (Total Revenue, Avg Rating, Avg Runtime, Total Votes, etc.)

Interactive Dashboard with slicers for Year, Genre, and Director

📊 Key Outcomes:

Identified the top 10 movies contributing the largest share of total revenue.

Highlighted genre-level insights: Action & Adventure dominated revenue, while Drama maintained consistently high ratings.

Discovered peak years (2008, 2010, 2014, etc.) with both the highest releases and box office revenue.

This project strengthened my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights and demonstrate data storytelling with Power BI.
